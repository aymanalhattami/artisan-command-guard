## :book: Introduction
Artisan Command Guard is a Laravel package that prevents critical artisan commands to be run in production environment.

## :toolbox: Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```
composer require dev-moez/artisan-command-guard
```

The package will automatically register itself.

And to publish the config and the migration files needed for the package, run the following artisan command:
```
php artisan artisan-command-guard:install
```

Or Manually:


You can publish the config file using the following command:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="artisan-command-guard-config"
```
This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
<?php

/**
 * An array of environments with the commands that you want to prevent running on
 */ 
return [
	'production' => [
		'migrate:refresh',
		'migrate:fresh',
		'migrate:reset',
	],
];


```


## :gear: Configuration

In the configuration file of the package `artisan-command-guard.php` you will find an array with production environment and the commands that you would like to prevent from running on production. Initially you will find three commands that I find dangerous to run on production:
- migrate:fresh
- migrate:refrest
- migrate:reset

You can add more commands or custom commands that you don't want to run in production env.
Also, you can set another environment and assign the commands that you would like to prevent from running - like done with `production`.
